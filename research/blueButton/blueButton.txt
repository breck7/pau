Test Name: EGFR
Result: 18 Low
Units: --
Reference Range: (>60)
Interpretation: An eGFR <60 is abnormal.
Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) results >60 are imprecise.
Many variables affect the calculated result.
Interpretation of eGFR results >60 must be monitored over time.
Units are mL/min/1.73m^2.
The following is the IDMS traceable MDRD Study equation (for creatinine
methods calibrated to an IDMS reference method)
EGFR (Ml/min/1.73m^2) = 175 x S^-1.154 x (AGE^-.203) x (0.742 if female)
x (1.212 if African American)
The equation does not require weight or height variables because the
results are reported normalized to 1.73 m^2 body surface area, which is
an accepted average adult surface area.

GROSS DESCRIPTION:
     Received labled with the patient name, medical record number and "left 
     tonsil" is a 2.5 x 1.5 x 1.0 cm piece of brown-tan soft tissue.  On cut 
     section there is an ill-defined white-tan 0.7 cm nodule noted.  
     Representative samples are submitted in one block.
      
     BC 5/5/17
     

MICROSCOPIC EXAM:
     DIAGNOSIS AFTER MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION: 
      
     TONSIL, LEFT, TONSILLECTOMY, TEST CASE:
      - MODERATELY DIFFERENTIATED SQUAMOUS CELL CARCINOMA.
      - NEOPLASTIC CELLS DIFFUSELY POSITIVE FOR P16.
      
     Comment: The hypothetical H&E stain sections demonstrate an invasive 
     moderately differentiated nonkeratinizing squamous cell carcinoma.  
     Immunohistochemical stain p16 shows diffuse strong staining within the 
     hypothetical malignant cells.  This case received intradepartmental 
     consultation by Provider One who concurs with the above diagnosis.
      
     NOTE:  "The Immunohistochemical staining test was developed and its 
     performance characteristics determined by Pathology & Laboratory 
     Medicine, PVAMC.  It has not been cleared or approved by the U.S. Food 
     and Drug Administration.  The FDA has determined that such clearance or 
     approval is not necessary.  This test is used for clinical purposes.  It 
     should not be regarded as investigational or for research.  This 
     laboratory is certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement 
     Amendments of 1988 (CLIA) as qualified to perform high complexity 
     clinical laboratory testing."
