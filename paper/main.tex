BASIC OUTLINE and NOTES

Define the problem: There is no consistent format or template for medical records
	- often electronic medical records (EMR) are stored in various forms and
	  formats
		- e.g. csv, xls, sas, etc...
	- there was a big push to have all hospitals use the same systems
		- has not been done and does not look like it will happen soon
		- resistance from users, administrators, stakeholders

Offer solution: Introduce Pau and Tree Notation
	- define a grammar for your tree language with respect to each EMR system
	- NLP tools, possibly powered by machine/deep learning, can help to
	  quickly define grammars and languages for EMR systems

Advantage of Pau:
	- hospitals and healthcare systems can continue their current workflow
		- charting and EMR entry can continue as usual 
		- clinicians do not have to learn a new tool
	- grammars, defined for each EMR system, can convert everything into a
	  consistant tree notation format
		- efficiently aggrigate/curate data 
		- medical field has entered the big data era
			- data consistency is important for big data analysis
				- e.g. machine/deep learning model construction
	* include code snipits and examples of Pau
		- or include example of tree
			- the toCSV() example in the sandbox is very practicle
			  and applicable to EMR

On going and future work
	- grammars for particular EMR systems are being defined
		- tools and techniques to optimize this process being worked on
		- a person/expert is needed to QA/QC the grammars etc
	- potential use cases and example of how it optimizes analysis pipelines
	- how Pau fits in the grand scheme or vision of tree notation
