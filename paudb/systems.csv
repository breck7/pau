Arden Syntax,Arden_syntax,1992,,"Arden syntax is a markup language used for representing and sharing medical knowledge.[1] This clinical and scientific knowledge language is used in an executable format by clinical decision support systems[2] to generate alerts, interpretations, and to screen and manage messages to clinicians. This syntax is used to share medical knowledge within and across many health service institutions.[2] Rule sets, called Medical Logic Modules, comprise enough logic to make a single medical decision.[1] Medical logic modules are written in Arden syntax, and are called by a program - an event monitor - when the condition they are written to help with occurs. Arden syntax was formerly a standard under ASTM, published in 1992, and is now part of Health Level Seven International.[2] Arden syntax version 2.0 was published by HL7 in 1999. Arden syntax version 2.10 is the current version.",,,

Big Data for Better Outcomes,,2017,https://www.imi.europa.eu/projects-results/project-factsheets/bd4bo,"Institutions across Europe house rich databases with detailed personal and biological information. If linked, this ‘big data’ has the potential to deliver insights that will allow healthcare systems to ensure that the patient is truly at the centre of decision-making, with health outcomes that matter and resources focused on treatments that really make a difference. IMI’s Big Data for Better Outcomes (BD4BO) programme is generating knowledge, data and methodologies needed to support the transition towards more outcomes-focused, sustainable healthcare systems in Europe. Through its projects, the programme focuses on a number of key therapeutic areas, namely Alzheimer’s disease, heart disease, and certain cancers.",,,
